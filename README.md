# Game-Engines
A course I did that teaches the student to understand what kind of game engines and libraries are available, and thoroughly learns to use one particular engine. Student also learns basics of 2D and 3D graphics, and can manage the workflow between different tools. The engine we used in the course was Unity. Lidias Apples is the game we made.
